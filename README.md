<h1>INSTAGRAM CLONE</h1>

I developed an Instagram clone using React Native, leveraging a Figma template. It features a robust navigation system powered by @react-navigation/bottom-tabs and @react-navigation/native. Additionally, date management is optimized with dayjs. The UI incorporates aesthetic gradient effects using react-native-linear-gradient. The app runs smoothly on both iOS and Android platforms, adhering to the UI guidelines for each.
